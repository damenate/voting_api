##Voting with Rails

  Using rails application for the first time and working through the steps to create APIs, databases, and run test driven development.
  In this assignment I have created an flowchart explaining the connection between  candidates, voters, and votes.
  As the first assignment to use rails, we are tasked to create migrations and models as needed and use test driven development.
  Within these classes we are required to add associations and validations for each class while running our test and connecting to our rails server.

  Create the candidates controller with an index action
  Make sure that you can access it in your browser
  Delete README.rdoc and make your own (filled in) README.md
  Push to GitHub
  Create an estimate for the number of hours you expect to need to complete this assignment tomorrow night
